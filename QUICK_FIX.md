# 🔧 Quick Fix for sudo Issues

## Problem
If you encounter `sudo: command not found` error when running the setup script, it means you're in an environment where sudo is not available (like some Jupyter environments).

## ✅ Solution: Use the Simple Setup Script

I've created a simpler setup script that avoids system package installation issues:

### Instead of:
```bash
bash setup_and_run.sh full
```

### Use:
```bash
bash simple_setup.sh full
```

## 🎯 What's Different?

### Simple Setup Script (`simple_setup.sh`):
- ✅ **No sudo required** - Only installs Python packages
- ✅ **User-level installation** - Uses `--user` flag for pip
- ✅ **Robust error handling** - Continues even if some steps fail
- ✅ **Jupyter-friendly** - Designed for notebook environments

### Commands Available:
```bash
bash simple_setup.sh deps        # Install dependencies only
bash simple_setup.sh test        # Test installation
bash simple_setup.sh run         # Start locally
bash simple_setup.sh run-share   # Start with public URL
bash simple_setup.sh full        # Complete setup and start (default)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start (Fixed)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/rdlogout/skyreel.git
cd skyreel

# Use the simple setup (no sudo needed)
bash simple_setup.sh full
```

## 📱 For Jupyter Notebooks

The updated `SkyReels_V2_Jupyter.ipynb` now uses the simple setup by default:

```python
# This will work without sudo issues
!bash simple_setup.sh full
```

## 🔍 What the Simple Script Does

1. **Checks GPU** - Detects NVIDIA GPU availability
2. **Creates Directories** - Sets up required folders
3. **Installs Python Packages** - PyTorch, Gradio, all requirements
4. **Tests Installation** - Verifies everything works
5. **Starts Interface** - Launches Gradio with public sharing

## 💡 Why This Works Better

- **No System Dependencies** - Avoids apt-get/yum issues
- **User Installation** - No admin privileges needed
- **Environment Agnostic** - Works in Colab, Kaggle, Jupyter, etc.
- **Error Tolerant** - Continues even if some steps fail

## 🎬 Ready to Go!

Your system is already compatible (passed 6/6 checks), so just run:

```bash
bash simple_setup.sh full
```

This will install everything and start the Gradio interface with public sharing! 🚀
